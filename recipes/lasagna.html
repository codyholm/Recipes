    <h2>Mexican Lasagna for those that don't like lasagna</h2>
    <p>This is a very delicious traditional mexican dish. Anyone can make it and have an amazing meal. It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion but has little similarity to pasta lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and discard any excess grease. Add water and taco seasoning; cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish; spread about half the can of refried beans and half the ground beef atop the tortilla layer. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over ground beef layer. </li>
        <li>Arrange 3 more tortillas over the cheese. Spread in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce; sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.</li>
        <li>Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese. Top with last 3 tortillas and remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.</li>
        <li>Turn on oven's broiler. Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack cheese is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious Mexican Style Lasagna!</li>
